# Workshop

This repo contains plans, 3d-prints for workshop related tools, accessories, etc. It contains several sections, detailed below.




## Automation


### Generic stepper and ball bearing support

As the name says, it's a support to easily mount a NEMA17 stepper and a 608 ball bearing on flat supports. It is aimed at fast prototyping or generic building. 

**Note**. *I plan to use it for building my version of Matthias Wandel's "Computer controlled precision box joint jig" (https://woodgears.ca/box_joint/motor_jig.html)*




## Erika85


Jigs and accessories for the Mafell Erika85 table saw.

### Rail hook

The aim is to allow jigs to be easily clampled to the table saw's rails (sides, front or rear). The top of the hook is flush to the table and three holes with countersinks allow fixing a board used as base for a jig.
The hook is composed of two pieces, the smaller one sliding in the groove of the second one. The pieces are hold together and the hook is clamped to the table saw by means of a metric bolt (M6x60). Use a wingnut to make tightening the clamp easy.
